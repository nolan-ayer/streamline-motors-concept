Successful consumer engagement scales with the perceived credibility of the bodies with which their purchases are made. If an individual, company, or other entity has what may be perceived as poor image by the consumer, purchases would have a higher likelyhood of failure.

According to the Stanford Web Credibility Project conducted by the Stanford University Persuasive Technology Lab, the average consumer paid far more attention to the superficial aspects of a site, such as visual cues, than to its content. For example, nearly half of all consumers (46.1%) in the study assessed the credibility of sites based in part on the appeal of the overall visual design of a site, including layout, typography, font size and color schemes.

This data shows beyond a doubt that consumers are able to identify, and indeed do prefer designs that are more up-to-date, modern, and aesthetically pleasing.

With this in mind, the purpose of this repository is made clear - it is to show the potential in what Streamline Motors could have as their primary consumer facing image, ie website.

The implementation of more modern and refined web design would benefit the company by bettering consumer impressions thus generating more sales.

This project is not made to distract potential customers from the real site. This project is only intended to be used for the purpose of the showcase of stylistic differences between the current implementation of streamlinemotorswa and what is possible with more modern style.
